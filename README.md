# ðŸš€ YOOM - Video App

An experimental Zoom Clone inspired by Javascript Mastery.

## Technologies Used

This project is built with several cutting-edge technologies:

### Next.js 14

[Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) is the latest release of the popular React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.

### Server Actions

Server Actions in Next.js allow developers to write server-side logic that can be directly called from the client. This simplifies building interactive applications by reducing the need for additional serverless functions or configuring backend routes.

### Getstream.io

[Getstream.io](https://getstream.io/) provides scalable APIs for building social networks, activity feeds, and chat applications. It is designed to reduce development time and handle the complexities of real-time data syncing across clients.

### Clerk

[Clerk](https://clerk.com/) is a service that handles authentication and user management for modern applications. It seamlessly integrates with any technology stack and simplifies securing and personalizing user experiences.

### Shadcn

[Shadcn](https://shadcn.com/) is a component library for React that allows developers to quickly build beautiful and responsive UIs with a design-first approach. It offers a range of customizable components that are easy to implement.
